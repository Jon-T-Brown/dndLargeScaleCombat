A simulator for large scale table top combat. 

As of right now this is in the very early stages of development

This simulator attempts to be somewhat true to the dnd 5e ruleset, it will use hp, ac, "roll a d20", "roll a damage die", and add hit and damage modifiers

If you have any desire to actually use this, you should modify the army1.json and army2.json files to match the army setup of the two armies involved in combat, it should be relatively clear how to edit them to configure different amounts of different types of troops

This will not run uber fast, and will run exponentially slower as you add more units to either side of the army.

It is currently extremely limited, enemies will not attempt to damage your players, it's not made well for sieges or anything like that, and a million other limits.

Also please just have you players one-shot enemies for now.

If you're a programmer and have recommendations for the code here or you're a DM and have recommendations, please feel free to leave some sort of comment with a request
